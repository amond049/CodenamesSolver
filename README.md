# CodenamesSolver
A GUI Python tool that can solve any codenames board given the first couple of guesses. Just a simple tool that I wanted to create because inspiration struck while playing this board game with my friends. 

# IMPORTANT NOTE:
You will need to have Python installed for this application to work. Some more information can be found here: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once installed, there are some additional modules required for this program to work, these can be found in the ```requirements.txt``` file. To install all of these all at once, you can use the command ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` so as to not worry about missing any modules. 

Thank you, enjoy the tool!
