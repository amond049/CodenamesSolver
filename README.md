# CodenamesSolver
A GUI Python tool that can solve any codenames board given the first couple of guesses. Just a simple tool that I wanted to create because inspiration struck while playing this board game with my friends. 

# IMPORTANT NOTE:
You will need to have Python installed for this application to work. Some more information can be found here: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once installed, there are some additional modules required for this program to work, these can be found in the ```requirements.txt``` file. To install all of these all at once, you can use the command ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` so as to not worry about missing any modules. 

Another important note, this tool will only work for the basic edition of Codenames, an image of which is attached below. For the online version or Codenames Duet, I cannot guarantee that the tool will work.

Thank you, enjoy the tool!
